    "5. Is Graph Bipartite?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a graph, return true if and only if it is bipartite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a graph is bipartite if we can split it's set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of indexes j for which the edge between nodes i and j exists.  Each node is an integer between 0 and graph.length - 1.  There are no self edges or parallel edges: graph[i] does not contain i, and it doesn't contain any element twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "Input: [[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [0,2]]\n",
    "Output: true\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "The graph looks like this:\n",
    "0----1\n",
    "|    |\n",
    "|    |\n",
    "3----2\n",
    "We can divide the vertices into two groups: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "Input: [[1,2,3], [0,2], [0,1,3], [0,2]]\n",
    "Output: false\n",

    "0----1\n",
    "| \\  |\n",
    "|  \\ |\n",
    "3----2\n",
    "We cannot find a way to divide the set of nodes into two independent ubsets.\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "    graph will have length in range [1, 100].\n",
    "    graph[i] will contain integers in range [0, graph.length - 1].\n",
    "    graph[i] will not contain i or duplicate values.\n",

    "Approach:\n",
    "========\n",
    "Assign RED color to the source vertex (putting into set U).\n",
    "Color all the neighbors with BLUE color (putting into set V).\n",
    "Color all neighborâ€™s neighbor with RED color (putting into set U).\n",
    "This way, assign color to all vertices such that it satisfies all the constraints of m way coloring problem where m = 2.\n",
    "While assigning colors, if we find a neighbor which is colored with same color as current vertex, then the graph cannot be colored with 2 vertices (or graph is not Bipartite).\n",
